It's *still* hard to keep up with this diary. No surprise.

At the farm today. Getting ready to pack up and head home. Came here Satrday afternoon after kids' basketball/cheer game. Today is MLK day. Julie and I still had to work some, but kids are off.

What is my legacy? What will I leave behind? Kids, great family story, this farm house and other things that come with that.

But what of hobbies? Creative enterprise? I read of a your man who built a simple online tool he used to create his own TV listings that would show up on his media server. Apparently there's people needing that sort of thing because he charges $1/mo and has, via grassroots, garnered enough income to pay the rent.

I think widgets like that that do hard stuff very easily is a good path. I like building widgets.
