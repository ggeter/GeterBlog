Coffee, in to work by 8:30 for morning call that didn't happen. No lunch, headed home early for dinner with kids at Akashi. Worked on Julie's old PC most of the night to get it working. Some issue with permissions on her new hard drive. Cooked a steak whe I got back home.

The more I've been eating, the better I feel for sure. And the exercize is helping. I also reached out to a local gym for pricing on their services. They offer weight training and cardio conditioning using the Starting Strength system. They're pricey.

Alex and Sam are in cheerleading and basketball, respectively, with Upword at Second Baptist Church. Their first game/cheer is this weekend.
