**Jan 4 2020**

__Activities__: Finished up ceiling paint of porch, cleaned garage, planted three small pine trees. Wrench IT call this a.m. Julie made a trip into town to bring inflammable garbage to her parents' house for pickup.  

__Food__: cookies, roast, coffee and cream, dark chocolate. Slowly getting back to no carb. Hard when you're not super busy and surrounded by holiday food.  

__Mood__: blueish, but great outlook. Looking forward to getting work projects started.
