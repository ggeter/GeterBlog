## Jan 4 2020

**Activities**: Cleaned, closed, and left farm. Best Buy in Lufkin so Sam could look at tablets, ate at Logan's. Delivered electric motors to MC for his next project. I exercised (reverse pullups and triceps extensions) and sauna at lifetime. Helped clean up Christmas decorations.

**Food**: Coffee, cream, steak at Logan's, toppings off of two pizza pieces.

**Mood**: Good. Enjoyed exercise.
