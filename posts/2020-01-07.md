## Jan 7 2020

**Activities**: Coffee, see kids of to school, drive to work. Work from 8 to 4. Left to pick up Alex from gymnastics and help her buy a new Chromebook at Best Buy. Ate at Smashburger with Alex and Julie. Came home, made a steak, hung out with kids while Julie was at Bear Branch Pool meeting.

**Food**: Fasted until 6-ish. Felt weak late in the day. I may need to be eating more calories.

**Mood**: Good, but some tired.
