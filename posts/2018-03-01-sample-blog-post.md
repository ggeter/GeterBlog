**Jan 2 2020 **

**Activities**: Mom and Dad at the farm. Easy morning with coffee and conversation. Cooked roast, eggs in sous vide bath. Dad and I welded. Dad rode electric go kart. I took a call for work to discuss planning the move to "modern desktop management" for Wrench. Mom and Dad headed home about 3pm. I finished up master bath ceiling trim, went in to town for dinner at Caf√© Tomas and some shopping at Atwood's and Harbor Freight. Watched Captain marvel with the kids.  Need to order headlights/spot lights for the Yuhoe. Was pretty harrowing taking it in to town in the dark and rain. 

**Food**: Roast and gravy thickened with poached egg yolk. Three cookies. One serving of dark chocolate. Two coffees with heavy cream. Chips, salsa, fajita meat. 

**Mood**: A little blue at times - this is our next to last evening at the farm. Even keel otherwise.
