Coffee, walk with kids to school, work from home. One call in the morning, not much done for work else. Eggs around 8:00, calf liver at noon, ribeye at 5. Exercize from 6 to 7:30 or so, then some programming with CMS.js

**Food**: See above

**Mood**: Much better than yesterday. Must be all the calories. Haha...
