It's hard to keep up with this diary. No surprise.

Perhaps I should start recording/transcribing musings and posting here. Or, on my new blog, the ["Finance and Health Emporium."](https://finance-and-health.blogspot.com/) haha.

I've already got some topics out there. Time may be less spent here and more there. So, be looking for that...

Sam and I ran his remote control truck at the church parking lot (1/15). That's one of the better gifts we've gotten him and it's surprising how well made it is for the $70-or-so we spent on it.

Alex and Sam had cheerleading/basketball practice (1/16). I'm glad Julie has lead the charge on getting them more immersed in different sporty things. I *never* would have done that myself.

Work is good -- filling my time with doing research. It's hard to get the ball rolling on projects at Wrench. Will work with Rob Sheesley (CIO) to get Paul Smith (COO) more involved on a weekly basis as we roll out these larger projects.

Food: dairy-free so far so good. Urination symptoms better, but that may be due to limited salt intake. Will keep an eye on it. Weight still bouncing between 160 and 162. It's a patience game, and I'm not concerned that 162 is "overweight," but I do want to get rid of this jiggly stuff on my belly.
