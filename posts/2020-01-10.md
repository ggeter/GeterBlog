Coffee, worked from home. Call with Rob and Ryan regarding moving forward on projects for the first quarter of 2020. Did some work, not too much.

Put my new weather station up on a pole in the back yard. They say a big storm is coming. Will be interesting to see the data. Mom and dad came over for dinner. Kids cookes a Raddish recipie. Swedish meatballs and things.

Kids slept in our room because of the storm -- it never really came and we watched Iron Man II.
