Stayed at home to work today. Had three work calls. Did some spreadsheet work.

Food-wise, I've decided to quit dairy for a bit. Eliminate it and see what happens. My urination problems are not better. Over the years I've had issues with enlarged benign prostate. While it's not *worse* than it ever has been, there have been times it's been better. And I need to rule out dairy. 

Sam and I went to Lifetime tonight and spend half an hour in the raquetball court. He took to it pretty well. Seemed to enjoy it. I played an hour after that with guys there. Went to sauna. Those times are good for me. Great for my mood.

Dinner for me was four eggs, cheese, butter, ice cream... a real nightmare. Will work to eliminate starting tomorrow.

Mood is good. Scramble brain, however. Can't decide what to do next from day to day. Also hoping eliminating the dairy alleviates some.
