Woke up as normal, coffee, drove kids to school and went in to work. Regular day - learning about Microsoft Intune features for upcoming project.

Cooked stuffed poblanos, ate, got ready to watch LSU vs. Clemson National Championship game. Had to turn it off after just a quarter -- was stressing me out. LSU ended up winning. They had a great year.

Still frustrated with programming hobby. Still eating as well as I know how (lots of protein, fat, low carbs). Feeling good, getting plenty of sleep.
