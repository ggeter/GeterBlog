## Jan 5 2020

**Activities**: Coffee, morning walk, thank you notes. Lunch at Mom and Dad's with family. To airport to be a "decoy" for bomb sniffing dogs. Ate at Carabbas.

**Food**: Coffee, cream, roast, rice, peas, steak, a cookie's worth of sweets.

**Mood**: Good. Ready to get back to work. Feeling entrepreneurial.
