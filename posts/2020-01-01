* Jan 1 2020 *

_ Activities _: At the farm. Barkers were here for the evening. Popped fireworks with their kids. Went horseback riding at Roselake Ranch. Mom and Dad drove in and arrived when Barkers left. Dad's got a new car - traded in his 2008 Lexus ES 350 for a 2018 Acura MDX. Visited, ate, played Yahtzee with the kids. Sam is loving the electric go kart. Alex loves to draw. I turned 49 yesterday.  

_ Food _: sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast tacos, no tortilla. Four hot dogs with chili and cheese. Small portion of cabbage and black eyed peas. Three large pieces of buttered corn bread. Coffee with cream, tea, a couple servings of dark chocolate. 

_ Mood _: neutral and easy going. Not much external stress. Ready to be alone for the next couple days.
