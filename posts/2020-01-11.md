Coffee, relaxing morning. Alex went to cheer camp early and Julie took Sam to a birthday party. I showered and went to see Alex's cheer presentation. Took pictures. Left there and went to Upward to watch Sam's first basketball game and Alex cheered at that. Took many pictures.

That evening, went to Braum's house to watch the Minesota Vikings vs SF 49ers playoff game. Not much of a game. Great visit, though.
